Naive Bayes Classifier
==============

This project contains a simple Naive Bayes classifier class along with an example of usage. This example predicts whether income exceeds $50K/year based on census data from the dataset known as Census Income (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult). Using the model generated by the included training set without any optimizations, the accuracy on the test set is ~83%.

Note: This example uses the STRTK library for splitting the CSV data files.

To run the classifier for income prediction:
--------------------------

1.  Compile:
      ```clang++ -std=gnu++11 -stdlib=libc++ strtk.hpp NaiveBayes.hpp NaiveBayes.cpp main.cpp```

2.  Execute
      ```./a.out [path_to_training_set] [path_to_test_set]```
    ex: with training and test data in same folder:
      ```./a.out adult.data adult.test```
