ML Collection
==============

I am currently working on implementing a small collection of machine learning agorithms here in this repository. So far, I have included the following:

* [Naive Bayes Classifier](/naivebayesclassifier) (C++)
* [Perceptron Classifier](/perceptron) (C++)
* [SVM w/ Simplified SMO Algorithm](/svm) (C++)
* [Multilayer Perceptron w/ Single Hidden Layer](/mlp) (C++)
* Hidden Markov Model (In Progress)

In these repository, each implementation is self-contained in its own Xcode project with instructions for running the contained files directly without Xcode if necessary.
